		<h1>About:</h1>
		<p>
			I am an aspiring full-stack developer, and have held a wide array of jobs, but my time as a teacher has
			taught me the most. For six years, I taught hundreds of students the basics of reading, math, and writing in
			preparation of college entrance exams. I learned how to lead a classroom, set expectations, and accomodate a
			vast array of learning styles.
			<br /><br />
			I learn quick, I work hard, and I have an ability to connect with people that has served me well throughout
			my career.<br><br><br><br>
